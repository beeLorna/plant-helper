  description:
    - Slugs are gastropods (which include snails)
    - They are soft bodied animals belonging to the mollusc group
    - They are consistently at the top of the RHS top ten list of pests
    - There are 44 species of slugs in the UK
    - Not all species cause damage to plants
    - Many feed on dead plant material and are actually beneficial to the garden
    - The range in size from a few mm to 12cm
    - It is often the smaller ones which cause some of the most extensive damage
    - They are active all year round (unlike snails), but warm damp conditions will see an increase
    - Most slugs feed after dark but can be seen in wet weather
    - Reproduction takes place mainly in spring and autumn when clusters of round whitish yellow eggs are laid in the soil or secluded damp spot
  symptoms:
    - Irregular holes in plant tissue caused by their rasping mouthparts
    - Whole young plants can be completely eaten, seedlings are particulary at risk
    - They will often leave behind a slime trail
  non_chemical_control:
    - Slugs are so abundant in gardens it is unreasonable to aim for complete removal and some damage has to be tolerated.
    - Traps - beer traps, grapefruit/melon skins - check regularly
    - Encourage predators - birds, frogs, hedgehogs, ground beetles, slow-worms.
    - Barriers - including rough or sharp textured mulches, straw based mulch or other substances thought to be distasteful or strong smelling.
    - Hand removal at night - torchlight search
    - Plant out sturdy, young plantlets - not younger softer seedlings, cover with cloches
    - Remove fallen leaves and dead plant material
    - Don’t overuse high nitrogen feeds that promote soft sappy growth - more prone to damage
    - Rake over soil to allow birds to eat exposed eggs
  biological_control:
    - A nematode (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita) that is watered onto the soil - it enters the slugs body and infects with a bacteria causing a fatal disease.
    - Requires a warm moist soil (5-20C). It is more effective on lighter well drained soils and less successful on clay soils. Apply in the evenings.
    - Can be used as a preventative (spring onwards) or once damage has been seen.
  chemical_control:
    - As of March 2021 there is only one type of slug pellet approved for use in gardens. It’s active ingredient is ferric phosphate.
    - From 2020 pellets based on metaldehyde were banned.
